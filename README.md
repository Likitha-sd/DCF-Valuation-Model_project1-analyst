🧾 README: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation Model
📌 Overview
This project estimates the Enterprise Value of a company using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method. By forecasting future cash flows and discounting them using a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), we derive a data-driven valuation that reflects the intrinsic worth of the business.
🧠 Key Concepts
- DCF Valuation: Projects Free Cash Flows (FCFs) and discounts them back to present value.
- WACC: Represents the company’s cost of capital and is used as the discount rate.
- Terminal Value: Calculates future value beyond the forecast period.
🧮 Final Output
📢 Estimated Enterprise Value: $216.09 million
